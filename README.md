## Introduction

Commit is a contemporary, full-stack blog platform powered by Django that I created to empower myself and other technology enthusiasts to express our thoughts and discoveries in the realm of modern web and software development. I envisioned this blog as a nurturing environment for the tech community, striving to build bridges and foster engagement among individuals of diverse backgrounds within the industry. The goal of this blog is to create a dynamic platform for people in the tech industry to connect with each other and exchange ideas covering the latest in web technologies, development practices, and industry insights.

When users sign up and create an account, they can fill out their profile to share their information with others in the tech community and showcase their skills and knowledge. They are also encouraged to write their own articles on any tech topic they wish to contribute to the community and help others, as well as comment on individual posts by other authors to share their thoughts and appreciation. Users can also sort through articles by category to find areas of tech they are more interested in, making for a richer user experience.

## Design

- #### Colour Scheme

  ### <img src="./readme-images/design/colors.png" alt="color palette for the website">

The blog features a clean and spacious design, utilizing a white background with subtle off-black accents for text and UI elements. This simplicity is balanced with vibrant colors in the images, adding visual interest. For easy navigation, article categories are distinguished by unique colors, enhancing the user experience with a professional touch.

- #### Typography

  ### <img src="./readme-images/design//typography.png" alt="typography list for the website">

Playfair Display was selected as the primary font for the website, chosen for its elegant serif style that complements a modern, clean design. To create a contrast, Inter, a clean sans-serif font, was employed for button text, form validation messages, and popup notifications, ensuring what I feel is a nice blend of classical and contemporary aesthetics.

- #### Components

  ### <img src="./readme-images/design/components.png" alt="ui component list for the website">

I embraced a component-centric approach in my UI design, focusing on crafting reusable UI components that can be applied in various contexts. This strategy ensures a uniform and cohesive appearance throughout the user interface, significantly enhancing the user experience on my site.

- #### Figma Wireframe

### <img src="./readme-images/design/figma-wireframe.png" alt="figma ui wireframe">

Knowing that I aimed to personalize the appearance of the base template, I turned to Figma to craft a visual mockup. Upon completion, this would allow me to transition more efficently into coding the CSS.

- #### Entity-Relationship Diagram

### <img src="./readme-images/design/erd-diagram.png" alt="the entity-relationship diagram">

Leveraging DrawSQL, I crafted an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for my PostgreSQL database. This approach proved invaluable, enabling me to visually map out the schema of each entity. It offered a clear, coherent view of how each of the tables interconnected within the database, significantly enhancing my understanding and management of the data structure.

</br>

## Agile Workflow

### Epics, User Stories and Tasks

#### Epics

### <img src="./readme-images/agile/epics.png" alt="list of project epics on Github">

Using Agile methods, I started my blog project by setting clear goals and deciding what features it would have. I identified the main themes, or "epics," which were broad outlines of what I wanted to achieve. These epics were like the big-picture goals of my project, guiding me towards what I wanted to build.

#### User Stories

### <img src="./readme-images/agile/github-project-user-stories.png" alt="list of project user stories on Github">

After defining all project epics, I broke them down into user stories. These stories were more detailed and focused on the needs and problems of my potential users. They helped me stay on track with my project goals, making sure I was building something people would actually find useful. For each story, I created a GitHub issue, describing the feature from a user's perspective and listing what criteria it needed to meet to be considered done.

#### Tasks

### <img src="./readme-images/agile/tasks.png" alt="list of tasks on a user story card">

I then listed all the individual tasks needed to complete each user story, breaking down the work into small, manageable parts. I used a checklist to keep track of what had been done and what still needed attention. This helped me stay organized and focused on the small details, ensuring that I met all the criteria for my user stories throughout the project.

### Github Project Boards

#### Github Project - User Stores List

### <img src="./readme-images/agile/github-project-user-stories.png" alt="user stories project board">

With the aid of GitHub projects, I grouped and organized all my user stories together in a project list view. This enabled me to visually grasp the most crucial aspects of each user story, and visualizing the interconnectedness between user stories and their respective Epics provided invaluable insights into the project's overarching goals and objectives.

You can see the project board here - <a href="https://github.com/users/ShaneDoyleDev/projects/7/views/2">User stories list</a>

#### Github Project - Kanban Board

### <img src="./readme-images/agile/github-project-kanban-board.png" alt="user stories kanban board">

I also implemented a Kanban board as an effective information radiator throughout each project milestone. This strategic approach enabled me to monitor the progress of tasks‚Äîfrom the initial backlog to current work-in-progress, all the way to completion. By visually mapping out each step of the process, the Kanban board provided a clear, real-time overview of the project's status, ensuring seamless tracking and management of tasks at every stage.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

### <img src="./readme-images/agile/moscow.png" alt="list of moscow labels on a Gihub project board">

I used MoSCoW prioritization technique to label each user story and prioritize tasks according to their significance to the project's objectives. This strategic approach enabled me to identify and focus on the most critical tasks first, ensuring the project remained on schedule. By optimizing my time management in this manner, I could concentrate on delivering the essential features required for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and other key deliverables, effectively steering the project towards its successful completion while aligning with the project's overarching goals.

- **Must have**: These are non-negotiable requirements that the project needs to be successful and meet the requirement scope of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
- **Should have**: Important but not vital requirements, which could be included if time and resources permit.
- **Could have**: Desirable but not necessary requirements. These are features that could be added as additional features and enhancements for the app in the future.

### Story Points and T-Shirt Sizing

### <img src="./readme-images/agile/t-shirt-sizing.png" alt="list of moscow t-shirt sizing values on a Gihub project board">

### <img src="./readme-images/agile/t-shirt-sizing-card.png" alt="list of moscow t-shirt sizing values on a Gihub project board">

T-shirt sizing is a popular method used in Agile to measure story points. This was what I employed as my chosen method to evaluate the effort required for completing each user story. User stories were compared against a benchmark task, with size categories ‚Äî ranging from XS to XXL ‚Äî assigned to represent the relative complexity and effort needed.

I learned about this agile estimation technique from these learning resources:

- <a href="https://activecollab.com/blog/project-management/t-shirt-sizing">T-Shirt Sizing - Agile Estimation Guide</a>
- <a href="https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing">How to Use T-Shirt Sizing to Estimate Projects</a>

### Project Milestones

The project timeline was strategically segmented into three key milestones, each representing a distinct sprint or unit of work: the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) milestone**, the **Post-MVP milestone**, and the **Enhancements milestone**. This structure played a crucial role in the planning and development phases, enabling me to prioritize the development of the most critical features first.

By adopting this approach, I effectively minimized the risk of allocating time to features that were not essential to the app's core functionality, ensuring a more focused and efficient progression towards the project goals.

#### MVP Milestone

This milestone encompasses all essential functionalities that are critical to the project's initial release. It includes fundamental features that the product must have in order to operate effectively and meet the minimum viable product (MVP) criteria. These tasks must be completed for the product to go live.

You can see this project milestone here - <a href="https://github.com/ShaneDoyleDev/commit/milestone/1">MVP Milestone</a>

#### Post-MVP Milestone

The post-launch milestone is aimed at enhancing the user experience and adding important features that were not critical for the initial launch. While these features are important to the product's overall value, they are not necessary for the core functioning of the platform. Implementing these tasks will further refine the user experience, add additional utility, and likely increase user satisfaction and engagement.

You can see this project milestone here - <a href="https://github.com/ShaneDoyleDev/commit/milestone/2">Post-MVP Milestone</a>

#### Enhancement Milestone

This milestone is focused on further enriching the platform with desirable features that could improve user interaction, personalization, and visual appeal. These are considered nice-to-have features that are not essential to the platform's primary functions but can contribute to the competitive edge, user retention, and overall marketability of the product. These tasks are scheduled for implementation once the more critical launch and post-launch features have been successfully completed.

## Deployment & Local Development

#### Local Development

1. Clone the repository from GitHub by clicking the "Code" button and copying the URL.
2. Open your preferred IDE and open a terminal session in the directory you want to clone the repository to.
3. Type `git clone` followed by the URL you copied in step 1 and press enter.
4. (Optional): Set up a virtual environment in the project folder using `python3 -m venv [virtual_environment name]`
5. (Optional): To activate the virtual environment on Windows run `myvenv\Scripts\activate` and on macOS and Linux, run `source myvenv/bin/activate`
6. Install the required dependencies by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
7. **Note**: The project is setup to use environment variables. You will need to set these up in your local environment. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for more information.
8. Connect your database of choice and run the migrations by typing `python manage.py migrate` in the terminal.
9. Create a superuser by typing `python manage.py createsuperuser` in the terminal and following the prompts.
10. (Optional):: Fixtures for Users and also the individual blog posts are included in the project in the `fixtures` directory. To add the pre-populated data to the database, run `python manage.py loaddata fixtures/[fixture_name].json`.
11. Run the app by typing `python manage.py runserver` in the terminal and opening the URL in your browser.

#### Heroku Deployment

1. Ensure the project repository has been uploaded to Github.
1. Login to the Heroku dashboard and create a new app.
1. Connect your GitHub repository to your Heroku app.
1. In the Settings tab, ensure that the Python Buildpack is added.
1. Set environment variables in the Config Vars section of the Settings tab.
1. In the Deploy tab, enable automatic deploys from your GitHub repository.
1. Click the "Deploy Branch" button to deploy the app.
1. Once the app has been deployed, click the "Open App" button to view the app.

#### Environment Variables

- For local deployment, you will need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project and set the environment variables in this file.

- **Note**: Ensure the .env file is included in the .gitignore file to exclude it from your GitHub repo to prevent the environment variables from being publicly exposed.

- For Heroku deployment, you will need to set the environment variables through the Heroku CLI or through the Heroku dashboard under 'Config Vars'.
- You need to define the following environment variables:

  - `SECRET_KEY`: The secret key for your Django project. This is a critical setting that's used for cryptographic signing, and should be kept secret at all times. It's used to provide cryptographic signing, and should be a long, random string of bytes.

  - `DEBUG`: A boolean that turns on/off debug mode. Set to `True` for development to enable detailed error pages and logging for debugging. Set to `False` in production to improve performance and security.

  - `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for your database. This should include the database engine, username, password, host, port, and database name. For a Postgres database, it typically looks like `postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME`.

  - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Your Cloudinary account's API key. This key is used to authenticate requests to Cloudinary's services for uploading and managing images and other media assets.

  - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Your Cloudinary account's API secret. This secret is used alongside the API key to securely sign requests to Cloudinary.

  - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your Cloudinary account's cloud name. This is the unique name that identifies your cloud within Cloudinary. It's used in the URL structure for accessing uploaded resources.

## Credits

### Code Used And Tutorials

- [Code Institute: Developing With Django](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/diplomainsoftwaredevelopmentecomm) - This series from Code Institute served as a solid introduction to the Django framework by walking me through how to build and deploy a Django app to Heroku.

- [Udemy: Python Django - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-django-the-practical-guide/) - This course helped me dive deeper into Django, covering many aspects of the framework in greater detail.

- [Very Academy: Learn Django Class-Based Views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxA2I-n8NR8&list=PLOLrQ9Pn6caxNb9eFZJ6LfY29nZkKmmXT) - To gain a solid conceptual grasp of class-based views, working through this playlist series from Very Academy on YouTube helped me explore how each view works in detail through examples.

- [Django Documentation: Custom Template Tags And Filters](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/custom-template-tags/) - For developing custom logic to assign category colors to each of my blog posts, I learned to implement custom filters from this section of the Django documentation.

- [Django Documentation: Data Fixtures](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/howto/initial-data/) - To efficiently populate my database with data, I learned about fixtures, how they work, and how they can be loaded into a database from this section of the Django documentation.

- [Colt Steele's Git and GitHub Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/) - As my project grew, maintaining a clear and secure git history became paramount. Initially, I had inadvertently included my API keys along with me Django secret key in my Github repository via the settings file. To enhance security, I altered my earlier commit history to move these keys to a `.env` file. The chapter on using interactive rebase was instrumental in enabling me to refactor those previous commits, ensuring the complete removal of the API keys from the commit history and thus avoiding a potential security vulnerability.

### Content

The content for each blog post was created with help from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), starting from titles I provided. After getting the initial drafts, I went through and fine-tuned them to make sure they were just right. Then, I saved these polished posts as picture files before uploading them to our database. This process combined the convenience of AI with a personal touch to ensure quality.

### Media

- [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) - This was the icon set I used for all icons across the website.
- [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) - All images were generated with the usage of Midjourney.

### Acknowledgments

- My Mentor [Lauren-Nicole](https://github.com/CluelessBiker) - who offered excellent advice, provided solid feedback, and supported me during my work on this project.

- The Code Institute Community - Both my class and the community have been invaluable. Having access to a wonderful group of people who share my passion for coding has significantly aided my journey in coding thus far.
